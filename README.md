# Quarkus3-Full-Stack-Quarkus-and-React
A copy project from PacktPublishing / Full-Stack-Quarkus-and-React with Quarkus 3

## About this project
Although the source code is based on that from PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Quarkus-and-React, the entire project was created from scrach (for practice).

The backend application has been rewritten using Quarkus 3 instead of the version 2 which is used in the original project.
